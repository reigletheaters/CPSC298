  // Within the while loop, have the Game object, game, call the play() member
  // function. Then, prompt the user if they want to play another game. If so,
  // iterate through the while loop again, otherwise, set bPlay to false (so
  // that the while loop will cease iterating). Consider using logical
  // expressions like ('y' == cPlay) as in earlier assignments to check the user
  // input.
